# Grails5-Zkui

Code for the project is copied and adopted from: https://github.com/xiaochong/zkui/

## Introduction

ZK UI plugin,the same as the ZKGrails plugin, seamlessly integrates ZK with Grails' infrastructures. 

The difference is it uses the Grails' infrastructures more, such as gsp, controllers rather than zk's zul.

The goal of the project is to migrate the old zkui to newer Grails & ZK version (Grails 5.3.2 + ZK 9.6.3) since the repository on GitHub has not been touched in 10 years. Grails & ZK version used in the original
project is Grails 2.2.4 and ZK 6.5.4.
