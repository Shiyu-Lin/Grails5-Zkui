# Grails5-Zkui

Code for the project is copied and adopted from: https://github.com/xiaochong/zkui/

## Introduction

ZK UI plugin,the same as the ZKGrails plugin, seamlessly integrates ZK with Grails' infrastructures. 

The difference is it uses the Grails' infrastructures more, such as gsp, controllers rather than zk's zul.

The goal of the project is to migrate the old zkui to newer Grails & ZK version (Grails 5.3.2 + ZK 9.6.3) since the repository on GitHub has not been touched in 10 years. Grails & ZK version used in the original
project is Grails 2.2.4 and ZK 6.5.4.

## Getting Started
TODO: Understanding the directory structure.\
TODO: Step0: change the repositories{...} field in build.gradle in grails5-app & zkui directory to point to public repositories, 
currently the maven repositories are pointing to McGill University's artifactory which is not publicly available. \
TODO: Step1: how to include the plugin into a Grails application. \
TODO: Step2: how to use the features offered through the plugin in .gsp files. \
TODO: Include some example code snippets. 

## Plugin Configuration File 
TODO: a few words about ZKuiGrailsPlugin.groovy file in Zkui/src/main/groovy/zkui

## Trouble Shooting / Known Errors
TODO: expect Failed to invoke class org.zkoss.zkmax.init.WebAppInit error which sames
to not impact the functionality of the plugin, need more investigation/any help.
